On the fly, I found no way to check which PVS servers & service are online. This is especially important if I want to issue PVS commands from Remote / Orchestrated. 
Enclosed I have made a small script block to check this. It is certainly not the best way, but it works. 
One possibility would be to retrieve the status of the PVS-services, but it is unclear whether one can actually connect to the servers trough PVS commands.
